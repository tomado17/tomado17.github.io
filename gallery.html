						<p> My name is <strong>Kasija</strong>
						<br>I was brought to the shelter by sanitary services. I was about to be euthanized there. Not becouse I was sick or other reasons, just becouse my time being there has expired. But as it turned out, it was not my time to die. That day as February 13th - I declare it my second birthday!
						<br>
						I came here very scared and traumatized. All my life I have lived in a cage. I was afraid of humans, dogs, sounds, smells, falling leafes, pretty much everything. If you would see me today, you would not believe that I was so frightened. 
						<br>
						 With a lot of time and work with great people I am a friendly, social, fun and extremely beutiful dog. I learned to sit calmly in car, I know what is taking a ferry boat, chill in a cafe, walk around the city. I saw the sea, fields and met a lot of people and dogs. What was my greatest horror in the past is now my entertainment.
						 I am constantly smiling, ready to pounce into a loving person's hug. Ofcourse, slowly, carefully, so nobody would become upset. Life is brilliant and I love every moment of it.<br>
						 Oww... I would love to find an owner, who could make my life even more exciting! I am worth it!

				<p> My name is <strong> Maverikas </strong>
				<br>
				Leave the security of your home to me! I feel the need to tell you more about myself.
				<br>
				I am a very honorable dog. Mr. Inteligent, or atleast how my best friend calls me. I am strict for people who do not belong here. And when I say strict, I'm not saying this just for show. I have my rules and I follow them!
				</p>
				<ul>
				<li> You can enter my home only with the permission of my owners </li>
				<li> Don't push your luck with trying to buy me off with snacks or cuteness. </li>
				<li> Please do not interupt my naps, especially if I do not know you. </li>
				</ul>
				<p> But when we are friends, it is completely different!
				<br> I am very loyal, friendly, happy and devoted. I am always waiting with a broad smile.
				<br> Just one problem - I want to find an owner that is just like me. Intelligent and friendly.

				<p> My name is <strong> Naina </strong>
				<br>
				I know that my previous shelter home are happy to see me finnaly find my own family.
				<br>
				Starting today, I am oficially Kamile's dog! But probably I was already her's when we first met.
				<br> 
				Everytime she came to my old home, she would take me to the sea, or to the park or to her work! While at first I was afraid of
				a lot of things, I am not anymore. 
				<br> I even managed to find a mutual understanding with Kamile's cat! 
				In the past, I almost knew nothing. But when I met Kamile, I learned a lot of things, becouse an owner with a good heart and a dog can 
				become friends for life!
