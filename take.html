				<h1> Adopting a Dog</h1>
					
					<h3> 1. Take your time before taking a decision </h3>

				<h1> Adopting a Cat </h3>
				<h3> 1. Cats are very teritorial animals, make sure they have their own territory </h3>
				<p> In the first days or weeks of your new cat arrival, make sure the cat has some place to call her own.
				This all new space might be confusing for your cat, so make sure she has her own hideout or a place where she will not be disturbed too much.
				A small room would be a perfect place.
				</p>
				<br><br>
				<h3> 2. Make sure your cat has a litter box </h3>
				<p> Before bringing the cat home buy a litter box and place it in some private place where the cat can do her <i> business </i> withouth disturbance
				Do some research on cat litter to make sure you buy the one that suits your needs. 
				</p>
				<br><br>
				<h3> 3. Set up a place for cat food and drink </h3>
				<p> Make sure the place to eat is further away from the litter box. Once you choose a place, try to make it constant, so the cat would learn
				of the place where she can always get some food and drink. Choose the size of the bowls accordingly to your cats size.
				</p>
				<br><br>
				<h3> 4. Cat claws require them to be used, make sure it is not furniture </h3>
				<p> Cats scratch their claws on random things, this is in their nature. Buy some special cat scratchers to make sure cat is not sharpening her claws
				on your furniture. There is a wide variety of scratchers of different materials and sizes. Play around with these models to make sure the cat finds what 
				it likes the most.
				</p>
				<h3> 5. Imagine yourself being a cat </h3>
				<p> Look around your home in the cat's eyes. There might be a lot of places the cat can get to, where you would not image. Make sure there are no hazardous
				items on top of the objects, as cupboards, shelves or wardrobes. Also, make sure there are no air wents or other dangerous holes in the house that the cat
				could enter.
				</p>
				<br><br>
				<h3> 6. Make some ground rules with other family members </h3>
				<p> If there are other people in your home, make sure everybody is aware of some ground rules how to treat the cat. Animals love consistency, so make sure
				everybody is aware of the private space the cat needs, the way it should be treated and other things. Once everybody is aware of this, the cat should
				interact with everybody in the house accordingly and not choose it's mortal enemy.
